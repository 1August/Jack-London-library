My project consists index.html - HTML file, style.css - CSS file, 
js.js - JAVASCRIPT file (With jQuery library).

In my work I used Bootstrap technology. You can see them in creating 
containers, rows, columns, tables, forms, buttons, navbars, footers.
Also I connected it with my own CSS file to change some styles. For 
example, colors of background, fons color, it's size, margins, paddings, 
hover effects, used pseudo classes, text positionings, display, 
flexboxes, media, video from youtube and etc.

For scripts I wrote with functions css editings, DOM manipulations, 
alerts, adding and removing classes, timeout functions, hover 
effects, worked with media function like window.width, sliders 
and animating.
